# NETracer: A Topology-Aware Iterative Tracing Approach for Tubular Structure Extraction
NETracer treats curvilinear structures as continuous node-edge sequences instead of isolated points.
By jointly predicting the next node and its connecting edge, the tracer no longer “jumps” to adjacent branches even in noisy or densely packed regions.
